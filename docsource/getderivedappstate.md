## getDerivedAppState

### `static getDerivedAppState(appState)`

Similar to `getDerivedStateFromProps`, Amorphous supports a static
`getDerivedAppState` method on the `RootAppComponent` only. This
function may be used to trigger additional modifications of appState
when appState is modified, which can be useful for caching expensive
calculations or time-unique values.

Example:

```javascript

```
