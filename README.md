# Amorphous

The easiest React state management library.

Amorphous is designed to help you get your app's state management up and
running as quickly as possible while avoiding as many pitfalls as possible
given the first constraint.

This is currently experimental; see src/App.js for usage.

NOTE: this is not currently transpiled, and needs to be.
