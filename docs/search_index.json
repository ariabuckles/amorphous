makes sharing state in react as easy as using setState.\nJust as this.state is a component's state and can be updated with\nsetState, this.appState is an app's state and can be updated with\nthis.setAppState:\nclass Input extends AppComponent {\n  render() {\n    return (\n       this.setAppState({ text: e.target.value })}\n      />\n    );\n  }\n}\n\nAmorphous is designed to:\n\nget your app's state management working as quickly as possible\navoid unnecessary pitfalls while doing so\n\nUsage\nAmorphous has two main classes:\n\nAppComponent: a class for components that use appState\nRootAppComponent: a class for the root component of your app\n\nTo use AppComponent, you must have a RootAppComponent at the\nroot of your app. (For library authors, see\nusing Amorphous in a library.)\nBoth AppComponent and RootAppComponent have access to:\n\nthis.appState\nthis.setAppState\nshouldComponentUpdate(nextProps, nextState, appState)\ncomponentDidUpdate(nextProps, nextState, snapshot, appState)\n\nFull Example:\nimport { AppComponent, RootAppComponent } from './amorphous';\n\nclass Input extends AppComponent {\n\n  render() {\n    return (\n       this.setAppState({ text: e.target.value })}\n      />\n    );\n  }\n}\n\nclass Output extends AppComponent {\n  render() {\n    return (\n      \n        {'You typed: '}\n
